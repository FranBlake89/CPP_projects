Reflect

With the completition of this Workshop, I could understand the functions templates and how to use it.
Also, how to call this functions and how to pass as an argument. These allows me to create functions
that could received any type of data, allow me simplify many things, for example; reducing the repetition of code, 
increase safety and can increase performance.
