In this workshop I learned how to combine structs and classes. 
In addition, I learned how to implement a copy constructor and copy allocation, 
techniques to avoid memory leaks. Finally, it was less challenging to read and write to files. 
The most difficult part was resizing the memory allocated for a 2D array, 
very useful when I tried to store data in an array when 
I didn't know how much data we will have in that file.
