Reflection WS-9

In this workshop I reinforce the rule of three; destructor, copy constructor, copy assigment operator.
This allow us avoid the shallow copies that default compiler create.
But it was difficult to complety understand the destructor in this rule, to avoid 
the errors messages in valgrind, this issue I could solve in milestone, the solution I implemented
did not effective in this workshop.
