REFLECTION

In this milestone I was able to learn how to store and manipulate arrays of objects, how to handle the memories leaks
that I had, and how to read a file into dynamically allocated memory. Also, I could understand deepper how to read 
files and manipulate the data of them, create a backup in case the data was deleted, using coustom  input/ouput. 
Finally, I could understand how to create functions that  help me to get access to set or get data from private 
or protected variable, apply the rule of three and its derived classes. It most challenging part was understand how
to define the prototypes in this milestone and then how to search the license and how to store the objects and delete them.
